1. Connect to http://localhost:8088/compliment.html
2. Connect your ClojureScript REPL to port 1345. With Emacs CIDER, run command
`cider-connect-cljs`, select `localhost` port 1345 and REPL type `nbb`.
3. After the REPL connects, evaluate the buffer and start hacking! With Emacs
   CIDER, run command `cider-load-buffer`.
